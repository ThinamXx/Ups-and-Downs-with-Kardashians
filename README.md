# **Ups and Downs with Kardashians & Jenners**

### __The Sisters and Google Trends__
While I'm not a fan nor a hater of the __Kardashians and Jenners__, the polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns to content.

The sisters in particular over the past decade have been especially productive in this regard. Let's get some facts straight. I consider the "sisters" to be the following daughters of __Kris Jenner__. Three from her first marriage to lawyer __Robert Kardashian__:

__Kourtney Kardashian__ (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1979)
__Kim Kardashian__ (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1980)
__Khloé Kardashian__ (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1984)
And two from her second marriage to Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce):

__Kendall Jenner__ (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1995)
__Kylie Jenner__ (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1997)

This family tree can be confusing, but we aren't here to explain it. We're here to explore the data underneath the hype, and we'll do it using search interest data from Google Trends. We'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of our own. And we'll answer the big question: is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?

### __The Early Kim's Hype__
- There is so much to make sense of here. Kim's sharp rise in 2007, with the beginning of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, among other things. There was no significant search interest for the other four sisters until mid-2009 when Kourtney and Khloé launched the reality television series, Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. Then there was Kim's rise from famous to literally more famous than God in 2011. This Cosmopolitan article covers the timeline that includes the launch of music videos, fragrances, iPhone and Android games, another television series, joining Instagram, and more. Then there was Kim's ridiculous spike in December 2014: posing naked on the cover of Paper Magazine in a bid to break the internet

### __Kylie's Rise__

### __Fluctuation of Sisters__
- Whoa, okay! So by this metric, Kim is still the most famous sister despite Kylie being close and nearly taking her crown. Honestly, the biggest takeaway from this whole exercise might be Kendall not showing up that much. It makes sense, though, despite her wildly successful modeling career. Some have called her "the only normal one in her family" as she tends to shy away from the more dramatic and controversial parts of the media limelight that generate oh so many clicks.
